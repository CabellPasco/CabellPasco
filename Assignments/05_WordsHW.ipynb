This should appear in a tiny font under the green checkmark next to the \"run\" button after the code finishes (without errors, of course).\n",

How can you set up code to implement that structure?  When you have something you are ready to try, **test your code on a smaller set than the whole word list!**  The reason for this is that the word list is long, and each time you run the code on the whole list it might take several minutes to execute.  \n",

Specifically, the (lower case) alphabetic characters are encoded with integers starting at 97.  So if you type `ord('a')` the output will be `97`.  If you type `chr(98)` the output will be `'b'`.  The way I solved the bonus problem, this tip was useful.  (See also problem 6.)\n",
